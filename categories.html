                <h2>Home Security</h2>
                <p>Cannot speak for everyone, but I would imagine there being no home owner who doesn't think about keeping their home safe and sound at some point or another..The troubling questions you might face might sound something like "Where do I begin looking?, What company is the best and most trustworthy?, Is it worth the cost for the service I am getting in return"...
                <br />
                All very reasonable questions to consider before making the committment! First off, try considering the needs of your home. This could mean the neighborhood itself, the size of the home, the amount of traffic that passes on your street and more. To get you started take a look at some of the more popular choices according to all these concerns we previously mentioned:
                <br />
                <h4>Alert System</h4>
                <br />
                Do you want motion-based or sound alerts or alerts for all activities? Email or push-based? They can also be set to provide audible notifications to help ensure you never miss an activity.
                <br />
                <h4>Camera Features</h4>
                <br />
                If your smart home security system comes with any camera(s) you’ll want to consider the features available on them. Our complete Outdoor Security Camera Buying Guide will help you find something that works for your needs.
                <br />
                <h4>Sensors</h4>
                <br />
                When looking at a smart home security system you’ll want to consider the included cameras, sensors, and alarms. Such considerations will depend on the size of your home and how much coverage you desire. There are window sensors, water leak sensors, those that detect smoke and carbon monoxide, and many more. Many systems will even include an audible alarm to deter intruders and alert anyone in the area to a break-in.
                <br />
                <h4>Installation</h4>
                <br />
                The best part of smart home security systems today is you can install most of the automated technology yourself, so you don’t need to shell out thousands to a security installation company or contractor. Consider whether you want a wired or wireless unit and if it requires drilling or an external power source.
                <br />
