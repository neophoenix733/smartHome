                <div class="container"><img src="img/smart-music.jpg"></div>               
                <p>Whether you are considering a complete home theater makeover or just a simple little voice activated musical something to get you through the daily chores, all is available to every consumer level! Let's start by looking at the two main components of smart home entertainment...Home Theater Audio and Visual! Given the kind of displays being manufactured today to accommodate modern technology, sound quality has definitely been somewhat compromised since screens are so much thinner and lightweight than they used to be. What's one of the many the remedies to this you ask? Soundbars! These guys have come a long way in producing a quality that is near impossible to match with a premium wired surround sound given a sound bar no greater than usually 3 feet long and a sub woofer to go along with it. Best of all, you are looking at a much more instantanious set up than your regular surround sound while avoiding the seemingly endless wires and cables that go along with it.

                <h2>Home Security</h2>
                <div class="container"><img src="img/ialarm.jpg"></div>
                <p>I Cannot speak for everyone, but I would imagine there being no home owner who doesn't think about keeping their home safe and sound at some point or another..The troubling questions you might face might sound something like "Where do I begin looking?, What company is the best and most trustworthy?, Is it worth the cost for the service I am getting in return"...
                <br />
                All very reasonable questions to consider before making the committment! First off, try considering the needs of your home. This could mean the neighborhood itself, the size of the home, the amount of traffic that passes on your street and more. To get you started take a look at some of the more popular choices according to all these concerns we previously mentioned:</p><button class="btn btn-primary" style="float:right;"><a href="https://www.homesecuritysystems.net/?vn=semv2-lst2-cl2-optime-front-ep05-topex01&t1=5000&t2=50&a=144&c=101944&s1=839861064.796993387&agid=44700794795&s4=c&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIienFyPDH2gIVBkOGCh1O8g9eEAAYAyAAEgJbHPD_BwE&s3=e.g.241855254173&s6=9030089&ls=g&cltest=true">View Systems</a></button>
                <br />
                <h4>Alert System<img src="img/alertsystem.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></h4>
                <p>Do you want motion-based or sound alerts or alerts for all activities? Email or push-based? They can also be set to provide audible notifications to help ensure you never miss an activity.</p>
                <br />
                <h4>Camera Features<img src="img/smartcam.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></h4>             
                <p>If your smart home security system comes with any camera(s) you’ll want to consider the features available on them. Our complete Outdoor Security Camera Buying Guide will help you find something that works for your needs.</p>
                <br />
                <h4>Sensors<img src="img/ringfloodlight.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></h4>              
                <p>When looking at a smart home security system you’ll want to consider the included cameras, sensors, and alarms. Such considerations will depend on the size of your home and how much coverage you desire. There are window sensors, water leak sensors, those that detect smoke and carbon monoxide, and many more. Many systems will even include an audible alarm to deter intruders and alert anyone in the area to a break-in.</p>
                <br />
                <h4>Installation<img src="img/installation-service.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></h4>
                The best part of smart home security systems today is you can install most of the automated technology yourself, so you don’t need to shell out thousands to a security installation company or contractor. Consider whether you want a wired or wireless unit and if it requires drilling or an external power source.

                <img src="img/control.jpg">
                <p>One of the best features of smart home control is having that control weather or not you are home! Your home is at the tips of your fingers. Forgot to adjust your thermostat to custom settings? Need to shut a light off that you forgot before you left the house or the oven perhaps? And my personal favorite, too tired after a long day to get up from your bed to turn off remaining lights or to arm the home? Well, this is where the phone comes in handy! All is adjustable from the phone.</p>

                <h2>Smart Appliances</h2>
                <img src="img/smart-kitchen.jpeg">
                <p>Picture specialized equipment programmed to run from a control center within your home. The benefit of this boils down to several factors. These smart appliances have the ability to sense an electrical surge and as a follow up, shut off their own power supply, shut off the mains in case of a flood or water emergency and even know when they need defrosting...As a personal peek of interest they even know how long to cook your meals, and rather than having you read up on the instructions yourself, some microwaves come equipped with a barcode scanner which will automatically cook according to the instructions on the box. Some can even keep track of expiration dates or can create recipes based on the ingredients in the cupboard. What if it's raining and you forgot to shut the windows? Your house can sense these things and will close the windows for you! But the most fascinating aspect of smart homes is that the possibilities are completely limitless because you can now actually communicate with your house. Just say the word!</p><button class="btn btn-primary" style="float:right;"><a href="https://www.smarthome.com/?utm_source=google_ppc&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Brand+l_DP1+2929&SK=adw-br-smarthome&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIit_7n_LH2gIVVFmGCh1U6ABcEAAYAiAAEgIPBfD_BwE">Start Shopping</a></button>
